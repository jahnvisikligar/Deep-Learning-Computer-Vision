# Deeper Networks for Image Classification

Image Classification is a challenging task that entails categorising images. Deep learning models are frequently used to solve the image classification problem. The purpose of this paper is to investigate various Deep CNN architectures by implementing RedNet50 and VGG16 and performing image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Both architectures were trained with similar epochs and batch sizes for evaluation.
